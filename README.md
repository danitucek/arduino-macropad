Simple Arduino macropad

I work as a system engineer, I have admin credentials via Active Directory to use with every server I need to login. I just enter my credentials and I am allowed to diagnose and work on that particular server... Only if it was so easy and I wouldn't need to alter the login credentials for each type of server, whether it's a Dell, HP or Supermicro.
